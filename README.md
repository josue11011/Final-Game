# Final-Game
This code is for the final project of this course which was creating our own game. This code is hosted on pythonanywhere.com and can be accesed by any one I share it with. This game was created completlery by using Python as the coding language. While testing this code I ran into an issue on pyhton anywhere because it was not alllowing me to run the code. I later figured out that the reason why I wasn't able to run the code was because it was not supported by my MAC. The reason being was that my software was out of date so it was not capable of running the console. I would suugest if you use a Mac that it has a better software than mac OS El Capitan version 10.11.6 I am not sure about windows computers though. Once the file is shared with you just press the run button on the top right corner and the game will begin. It will begin by asking your name and if you would like to start the game. Once you put yes the game will start with chapter 1 until you finish at chapter 5.
